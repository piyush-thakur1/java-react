# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone *https://github.com/piyush-thakur1/java-react.git*
   cd *java-react*
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the backend API URL:

   ```sh
   VITE_APP_API_URL=<your-backend-api-url>
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
